Introduction
============

This script provides an R equivalence of the RandomForest algorithm in 'LCC\_Footfall.ipynb', used in the predictive analysis of footfall datasets. The goal of this module is to compare the performance of the R version with the Python version, before its integration into a web-based tool designed for daily prediction of footfall data in Leeds City Centre.
